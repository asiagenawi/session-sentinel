versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Local estimation can no longer emit wildly wrong warnings (field incident:
  "1085.7% of the 5h window" with negative minutes-to-limit) when a leftover
  test/demo config carries a tiny `local_budget_weighted_tokens`:
  - Budgets under 100,000 weighted tokens are ignored on config load as
    test/demo leftovers (diagnostic logged, throttled hourly).
  - A local estimate above 150% now discards itself (the budget is garbage)
    with a diagnostic naming block tokens, budget, and budget source;
    estimates between 100% and 150% clamp to 100%.
  - `projected_minutes_to_limit` is floored at 0 — never negative — and the
    warning's "~N minutes away" clause only renders for positive projections.
- Endpoint fallback is no longer silent: a missing/expired OAuth token logs
  "no valid OAuth token; falling back to local estimation" (throttled hourly).

### Added
- `scripts/ci_estimate_sanity_test.py`: sandboxed regression test (tiny
  budget + heavy transcript + endpoint disabled must never produce a >150%
  warning or a negative projection); wired into unix and windows CI.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Plugin: `/powernap:toggle on|off` split into argument-free `/powernap:on`
  and `/powernap:off` (first-user testing showed the argument form invited
  mistyping).
- `claude-powernap version` now reports the real version from deployed
  copies too (shared VERSION constant, also used in the User-Agent).

### Added
- README: plugin troubleshooting (restart to register commands; CLI install
  fallback when the interactive install doesn't persist).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **PyPI packaging**: installable via `pip install claude-powernap` /
  `uvx claude-powernap setup`; new `setup` / `remove` CLI subcommands replace
  the platform installer scripts (install.sh/.ps1 remain as thin wrappers).
- **Claude Code plugin**: the repo is its own marketplace —
  `/plugin marketplace add asiagenawi/claude-powernap` then
  `/plugin install powernap@claude-powernap`. Hooks activate with no file
  deployment; `/powernap:watcher` schedules the OS-level fallback watcher;
  `/powernap:status` and `/powernap:toggle` included
  (`watcher-setup`/`watcher-remove` CLI subcommands back them).
- `claude-powernap version` command.
- CI: package build + wheel install + entry-point smoke test job; PyPI
  publish workflow on GitHub releases (trusted publishing).

### Changed
- Repo restructured to a src-layout Python package (`src/claude_powernap/`);
  install logic consolidated into one cross-platform code path.

### Fixed (pre-release audit)
- Rescue paths now share one ledger — a warned session that then hard-hit
  the limit can no longer be resumed twice (forked).
- macOS liveness check fails toward "alive" on lsof errors, matching Windows.
- Warnings are no longer emitted (and marked delivered) on Stop events,
  where injected context reaches no model turn.
- Local estimation dedupes by request/message id — `claude --resume` copies
  history into a new transcript and previously double-counted it.
- Keychain: full-keychain enumeration (`dump-keychain`) now runs only on a
  cache miss, never on the steady-state path; check cadence has a 15s floor.
- Usage requests self-identify as `claude-powernap/<version>` (verified
  accepted) instead of a claude-cli User-Agent.
- uvx installs embed a stable system interpreter (not uv's collectible
  cache path) into hooks/shims/scheduled jobs; re-running setup repairs a
  stale interpreter in existing hooks.
- Account switches also reset burn-rate samples; source flips
  (endpoint↔local) reset them too, preventing phantom burn spikes.
- Warn keys bucket the reset time to the hour, so endpoint drift can't
  re-warn mid-window; an active weekly stop suppresses the contradictory
  5h resume instruction.
- Watcher dry-run is truly read-only; rescue retries on failed resumes;
  resumed/notified ledgers prune after 24h; cwd is shell-quoted (and falls
  back to home when deleted) in resume commands.
- `status` reads state under the lock; `--debug` never writes unlocked.
- Partial `token_weights` config merges over defaults instead of crashing
  the scan; multi-machine calibration guarded by a substantial-usage floor
  and smoothing; missing-budget rescans throttled to hourly.
- Empty hook session_id falls back to the transcript filename.
- Removed a stale committed wheel from `dist/` (would have broken future
  publishes); sdist excludes demo/CI files; README/SECURITY corrections
  (Keychain enumeration disclosure, honest UA, cadence and trigger accuracy,
  uninstall matrix per install method, sleep/`caffeinate` caveat, absolute
  image URLs for PyPI).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Burn-rate prediction**: warnings also fire when the recent burn rate
  projects the limit within `safety_margin_min` minutes — catches fast
  (subagent-heavy) burns the static threshold misses.
- **Adaptive check cadence**: 30s above 80% usage, every hook event above 90%.
- **Pause ledger + rescue**: every pause is recorded; the watcher resumes
  napping sessions whose in-session alarm died (sleep/reboot/crash).
- **Weekly guard** (opt-in, `weekly_guard: true`): warn/pause on the weekly
  window; pauses without scheduling a resume since weekly resets are days out.
- **Account-switch detection**: per-account cached state clears automatically
  on `/login` to a different account.
- **Cross-platform state locking**: concurrent sessions can no longer race
  state.json (fcntl/msvcrt; 12-process CI test).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-18

Initial release.

### Added
- Usage monitor hook (`PostToolUse`/`UserPromptSubmit`/`Stop`): warns the live
  session at a configurable threshold (default 90%) of the 5-hour window,
  with the pause-checkpoint-reschedule protocol injected into context.
- Hybrid usage source: exact numbers from the OAuth usage endpoint with
  automatic fallback to local transcript estimation, continuously calibrated
  against endpoint truth.
- Fallback watcher: detects sessions that hard-hit the limit, waits for the
  reset, and resumes them visibly (new terminal window) — with a
  never-fork-a-live-session guarantee; notifies instead when in doubt.
- `claude-powernap on|off|status|log` CLI.
- Platforms: macOS (Keychain/launchd/osascript), Linux incl. WSL
  (credentials file/systemd user timer/notify-send, terminal auto-detect),
  native Windows experimental (Task Scheduler/toasts/wt).
- CI: full install→monitor→hook→watcher→uninstall cycle on macOS, Ubuntu,
  and Windows runners.
